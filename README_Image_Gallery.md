# TECHNICAL CHANGES: 

Right now I used a regular CSS with float property and some width spacing.I can also implement the image gallery using CSS grids functionality using some javascript style manipulation or Bootstrap framework or CSS FlexBox to build the grid layout. The another way of implementing small and big versions of the images is using anchor tags for full images.

# ADDITIONAL CHANGES: 

Including pagination I can add image descriptions below each image, Adding navbar on the top and implement additional pages,footer content below, some CSS animations and hover effects,transitions, transformations, box-shadows, opacity. I will also include some background colors or a specific image or some content instead of plain white background.

# Design, Maintainability & Re-usability:

Before releasing the application 
1. Implement modular code approach by split the code into MVC(Model, View, Controller) pattern. Always implement reusable code in separate functions to     write DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) code.Use Proper comments, data privacy.
2. If possible use immediately invoked function expression(IIFE) for data privacy and security.
3. For CSS don't write unnecessary code , DRY code, avoid nesting.      
2. Define an efficient folder structure.
